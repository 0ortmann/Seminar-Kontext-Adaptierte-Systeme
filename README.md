## Seminar 

Repo is for my presentation slides + text

**Note**: Theme (University exclusive) is not included, so the latex build will fail if you do not change the theme. Furthermore, the images for UHH and VSIS logo are not included.

The paper is (mostly) built with [this](https://vsis-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/vsis/teaching/templates) from UHH VSIS template for course papers. 

#### Graphics:

All the following images are not included in the github-upstream, but you can find the sources to the images below:

There is a very simple and well-explaining article on support vector machines to be found [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/10/understaing-support-vector-machine-example-code/). The graphics come from that article.
